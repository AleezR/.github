## Code of Conduct

The Nexus, SJCET is dedicated to providing a respectful, harassment-free
community for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment or bullying of
any community member in any form. This does not only extend to members
to the college community, but to anyone who chooses to become
involved in the larger community of users, developers and integrators
through events or interactions.

Harassment includes offensive verbal/electronic comments related to
personal characteristics or choices, sexual images or comments in
public or online spaces, deliberate intimidation, bullying, stalking,
following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of
talks, IRC chats, electronic meetings, physical meetings or other
events, inappropriate physical contact, or unwelcome sexual
attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing or bullying
behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, representatives of the
community may take reasonable action they deem appropriate, including
warning the offender, expulsion from any event, or expulsion
from mailing lists, IRC chats, discussion boards and other electronic
communications channels to resolve the issue. This may include
expulsion and ban from attending, participating and volunteering in any activities organized by The Nexus.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed,
or have any other concerns, please act to intercede or ask for help
from any member of the Nexus Core community, IRC chat admins, website
admins, or organizers/representatives of any physical events put on
under the auspices of The Nexus, SJCET.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an 
individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a 
project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an
official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or 
offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.
